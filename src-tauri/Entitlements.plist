        Required by WebKit's JavaScript JIT compiler.
        Tauri uses WebKit (WKWebView) for rendering the app's webview,
        and the JIT requires executable memory for performance.

        Required for SMB support via libsmbclient.
        The pavao crate dynamically links to libsmbclient (installed via Homebrew),
        which is signed with a different Team ID. This entitlement allows the app
        to load libraries with different or missing signatures.
        Tracking issue to remove this entitlement by bundling + re-signing libsmbclient:
